* [random-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-js): A versatile random number generation library for Node.js.
* [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv): A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
* [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon): A utility that monitors for changes in your source code and automatically restarts the server.
